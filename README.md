<div align="center"> In this compact project, I’ve utilized the Rick and Morty API to fetch character-specific data such as status, species, and associated images. The application includes additional features like filters, pagination, and a button that navigates back to the filters. The design is intentionally simple, focusing purely on the API consumption aspect. It’s also responsive for various device sizes. Stay tuned for a more sophisticated version in the future!
